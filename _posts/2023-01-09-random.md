###Random thoughts and some “hot takes”

* not being able to cook is not a cool flex. I mean, weird flex,but ok. It’s a basic life skill everyone should know at this point
* Boundaries and brown parents don’t add up *shrug emoji*. Maybe we can try but it gonna look different from what it looks like for white parents
* Saunas are like imagine if you were a Momo, you will turn into a yummy snack after
* Saunas are the new marijuana (yes, I’m at a sauna as I type this)
* Rupi kaur is NOT a pseudo poet, she changed my life
* Severance packages are not a cool flex, you still got laid off, that company is a bitch to do that to you
* *most* companies don’t care about mental health and neurodivergence
* Don’t refer to “bipolar” as an adjective (eg: “the weather in Bangalore is bipolar”)
* Try not to use the word “crazy” as it stigmatizes people with mental illness(this one I stole from Ilana glazer(broad city))
* Marriage doesn’t cure mental illness(dad, if you’re reading this)
* Having a manic meltdown to a Billie Eilish song is totally okay
* Billie Eilish and J Cole music could heal depression
* “I trained him” is not a cool flex, ladies
* People with mental illness should not stigmatize other people with a different mental illness than them(if anirudh or Neal Brennan ever read this)
* If you think everyone is “beneath” you or not “at your level intellectually” you are suffering from god complex and might have narcissistic personality disorder, please consult a doctor(also for anirudh)
* Being told to go to therapy is not a diss(last one for anirudh)
* The same person can be simultaneously toxin and honey

Ok that’s it for today- bye.
