I landed in Kansas city airport in August 2012. It was a scary but exhilarating experience. I didn't know what 'grab food' meant, so I made the other vietnamese international student wait and watch my luggage while I get burger king. Then the Truman crew came to pick us all up and take us to Kirksville. Fun bus ride! I will never forget how happy I was in my freshman year. So many cool opportunities, friends, foods, and fun.

But trying to keep this short. (Actually this might become a series)

Here's what I learned each semester at Truman:

Since its a liberal arts school, even if you're a STEM major, you gotta learn some non-STEM topics, which I really appreciate! This would not have been possible in India AT ALL. Recently a friend came over and argued that India has a 'very good education system' and I strongly disagreed, to that she said- 'maybe thats because you didn't get a good rank/score'. In that moment I wanted to throw her out of my apartment but I just did box-breathing in the bathroom and then later threw this in her face...

I'm just going to leave this here... #flex

[stuti (was) a 'topper' link](https://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080530/jal.htm) (more on this some other day in a different blog post(will mostly talk about the gross aftermath))

But jokes and snarks aside, It really is a big difference from Indian education system that lacks flexibility in the sense that you can't choose your own majors and minors or pick different classes to suit your schedule.

Other than learnings, I made some many cool friends from all walks of life...

Photographers, people majoring in both music AND math, half white-half asians, desi crowd I danced with, Saudi guy I had a crush on, the list is endless..

And Truman is also where I saw PETE DAVIDSON FOR THE FIRST TIME!!!!!!
