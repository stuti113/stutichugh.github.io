Hi, Happy Sunday y’all!

I have lost count of how many times I have watched this movie. It’s so helpful and relatable for me. I feel like the lead, and since I recently myself got myself a male therapist; the timing(to be rewatching this) is on point.

Shah Rukh Khan is a King Khan indeed but like yeah no therapist takes you to the beach. And you’re not supposed to hit on them haha.

But everything else is very real and on point. Especially navigating the dating world part. Befriending and dating someone with mental health issues can be hard but I do think men need to do *some* homework.

I think if you just read my fucking bio/blog you’d know that if you’re not into one of the following you should be self-eliminating yourself and not waste my time.

- Comedy
- Spicy food
- Mental health and neurodivergence
- Embracing my American-Indian mix personality
- Looking for something long term

Like “just fucking leave me alone”(Billie Eilish- Happier than ever) if you don’t meet these criteria.

But oh well- people be weird *shrug emoji*

Ok yeah, I digress, just watch this movie. It’s a 2.5 hr long therapy session!
