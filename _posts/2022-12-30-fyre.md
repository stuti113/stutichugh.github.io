I first watched Fyre festival during a work trip in an airbnb in Zagreb with my colleague Jloo. She's in marketing so she suggested we watch this to understand 'the power of marketing', which we indeed did!

During the whole time of my first watch in 2018, this Mindy Kaling gif is how we felt:

But upon watching it recently for the second time, post discovering that Billy MacFarland has [ **undiagnosed ADHD, bipolar, and alcohol abuse** ](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/founder-fyre-festival-mental-illness), things made a tad more sense.

Billy is a 26 year old entrepreneur who started his journey with _Magnisus_, a business where he marketed "newest, coolest black metal credit cards to millenials. Its all about exclusivity, access, and clout. Most people found him charismatic which makes sense because such people tend to exhibit grandiosity. He has been refered to as an "operational sociopath" in the documentary.

These three quotes kinda sum it well:

* “These guys are either completely full of shit or the smartest guys ever”
* “Is he a genius or a madman”
* “This man either knows something that I don’t or he’s certified insane”

He then goes ahead to advertise a once-in-a-lifetime Coachella-like music festival at Pablo Escobar's island in the Bahamas. They started an orange tile trend on instagram and marketed as it to be the hottest place to be. There were posts included from many big shot supermodels such as Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, and Hailey Baldwin. _Fuck Jerry_ picked up the story and they were super stoked about it. This was back in the day when they still had _mannequin challenge_. Many social media influencers were given free passes so there was even more hype building up.

It was rumored that Kendal Jenner was paid $250,000 just to post that ambiguous orange tile on her insta to promote the event. 90% of the tickets sold out within 48 hours.

But there was a combination of confusion and excitment around the whole thing.

This was the accomodation they were advertising. They oversold these lodge packages(like they do with flights)

There were (false) expectations set for workers in Bahamas that Billy has 'created' jobs for them.

Pretty soon FyreFraud twitter account started trending.

Soon they started realizing there are some serious miscalculation of budgeting and expectations. The employees first wondered if these are just regular startup woes or actual financial trouble. Employees of Fyre used to 'joke' at the end of each month asking each other if they got paid. Some said they got paid in 'a bag of cash'.

This kinda reminded me of the recent layoffs in the tech industry. Like I don't understand how do companies lack foresight at this level.

Some employees started 'leaking' the shitshow that Fyre was but then an email went around saying 'lose lips, sink ships' where Billy was basically threatening colleagues to reveal the whistleblower.

Eventually customers started asking questions but they got gaslit and their comments were deleted from the original instagram handle of Fyre to prevent defamation.

The evian water-blow job story is WILD (I'll let you watch it)

Eventually the Fyre fest site ended up looking like a refugee camp and there were no charter flights to fly to people back so they were basically stuck at this island with no food, no toilet paper, no mattress, or their luggage. It was an epic fail. Memes started rolling out, as they do. This pic from a guy went viral.

People started to victim blame these rich kids who decided to go in the first place. Someone said- "if you spend thousands to see blink 182, that's on you- Darwinism at its finest".

The whole thing became a laughing stock. There was one lawsuit after other. They were showing receipts and it was shocking because I have never even seen these kind of numbers on an invoice in my real life(hundreds of thousands of dollars!)

What was one of the most shocking thing to me was that Billy's business partner JaRule didn't think anything bad happened because "nobody died" and he said -"that’s not fraud, it’s just false advertisement". They were still so delusional after this complete disaster and were celebrating that this story got picked up by SNL.

Billy got sentenced to jail but got out on $500,000 bail. He moved from his penthouse to his parents' basement.

I feel the most bad about the Bahamian restaurant lady who had to feed all the staff and lost $50,000 of own savings due to this. It was heartbreaking to watch.

I still do not understand where do (unmedicated) men get the audacity? Why wont they go to therapy? I am very well aware how hard it is to accept a diagnosis but being in a constant state of grandiosity should be your first hint to book a session. I have also done some impulsive spending during my manic and hypomanic episodes but I would never swindle over TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE into buying into an experience that doesn't even exist. I usually go the other end(giving away my vans and my jacket to a homeless, buying them groceries etc- *think bipolar mother teresa* lol)

I also take ownership and seek therapy/meds but this man CONTINUED TO FRAUD PEOPLE AFTER GETTING THE BAIL!!! (Men like Kanye and Billy, make me feel a tad better about how I manage my mental illness.
