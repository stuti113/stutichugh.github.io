	I'm a traveller, a self-proclaimed comedian, and a serial binge-watcher. I occasionally also end up reading books and I also happen to be working in Data.<br>
		I created this website to share my experiences and stories about travelling and living in different countries. I also use this space to share my love for comedy and TV shows by sharing reviews and recommendations. <br>
		Sometimes I may also end up posting some miscellaneous stuff ranging anywhere from mental health to random "hot takes" to the climate change crisis to my favorite Trader Joe's items(now DM, because I am in Berlin now). We'll see... <br>
		Also even though this a github hosted website this is in no way a space to talk about tech stuff. If you're interested in knowing how I wrote this website or viewing my academic and professional projects please head over to <b> <a href="https://stuti113.github.io/">this website</a> </b> instead<br>
